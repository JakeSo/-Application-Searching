# Application-Searching

This is a project for which we implemented classical and local search algorithms.

Classical: \
  &ensp; Uninformed: \
  &emsp; -Breadth-first search \
  &emsp; -Depth-first search \
  &ensp; Informed: \
  &emsp; -A-star search \
  &emsp; -Greedy BFS search
    
  &ensp; Local:  \
  &emsp; -Simulated Annealing
